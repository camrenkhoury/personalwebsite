				     <h1>My Background</h1>
					 <p>I’m <strong>Camren Khoury</strong>, a student at 
						<strong>Clemson University</strong> majoring in 
						<strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and 
						<strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> graduating in May 2026.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        I am from <strong>North Charleston, South Carolina</strong>. I always had a deep 
                        interest in how technology works at its core, especially the way binary logic, 
                        circuits, and small changes in hardware or software can completely change a system's 
                        behavior. Early projects like building my own computer and repairing electronics 
                        strengthened my interest in engineering and pushed me toward a hands-on career.
                    </p>
					
					 <p>
						I chose to get a degree in both Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering because
						I wanted a complete understanding of both hardware and software. Computer Engineering 
						provides the middle ground between electronics and computer science, but taking additional 
						EE-exclusive courses such as electromagnetics, electronics, and power systems allows me to 
						understand how the systems I design work from the physical level up through embedded 
						software. This broader perspective helps me design solutions that are more reliable and 
						realistic.

					<h1>My Family</h1>
                    <p>
                        My partner <strong>Cadle</strong>, who is studying Elementary Education at 
                        <strong>Augusta University</strong>, and our daughter <strong>Delilah</strong> inspire me 
                        to approach engineering with purpose, discipline, and long-term vision. Balancing 
                        academics, leadership roles, and fatherhood has shaped my resilience and the way I 
                        approach challenges. 
                    </p>
					
					<p>
						I also have three sisters and a brother, all of whom currently live on the East Coast of the United States. 
						I am the second oldest on my father's side of the family and the oldest on my mother's side. Growing up, 
						I lived with my grandparents: my grandmother, Rosa, who played a huge role in my development as an adult, 
						and my grandfather, Donald, who graduated in 1958 with a degree in Electrical Engineering from Michigan State University 
						and later pursued a long, successful career with SPAWAR in North Charleston, SC.

            <h2>Academic Journey</h2>

            <p>
                During my time at Clemson, I have grown my skills in several course areas including 
                data structures, algorithms, electronics, and microcontroller systems. Highlights include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>: Building and debugging linked lists, heaps, and memory systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronics and Circuit Design</strong>: Hands-on labs with transistors, oscilloscopes, and curve tracers.</li>
                <li><strong>Analog Signal Processing and Op-Amps</strong>: Designing amplifiers, filters, and frequency-response circuits.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: PIC32-based projects including a Nuclear Meltdown Simulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I am proficient in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, with experience in 
                <strong>Swift</strong> and development on <strong>PIC32</strong>, <strong>ESP32</strong>, and 
                <strong>STM32</strong> platforms.
            </p>

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>

            <p>
                I aim to contribute significantly to the field of <strong>embedded systems</strong> and 
                <strong>microcontroller-based solutions</strong>, focusing on seamless hardware/software 
                integration.
            </p>

            <p>My areas of interest include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Embedded Systems Development</strong>: Healthcare, automation, and consumer electronics.</li>
                <li><strong>System Optimization</strong>: Improving device efficiency and design.</li>

                <li><strong>Software Development</strong>: Robust systems built with C-based languages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>

            <p>
                Outside engineering, I enjoy the <strong>gym</strong>, <strong>swimming</strong>,
                <strong>basketball</strong>, and spending time with my family.
