        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Camren Khoury</strong>, a third-year student at <strong>Clemson University</strong> majoring in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong>. I have a deep passion for technology and the ways in which engineering can transform the world around us. My academic journey so far has equipped me with a solid foundation in both hardware and software, and I am eager to continue applying these skills to real-world challenges.</p>

        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at Clemson, I have focused on honing my skills in various technical areas, such as data structures, algorithms, electronics, and microcontroller systems. Some of the key projects I’ve worked on include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>: Developing systems to manage and optimize data, including designing and debugging memory heap management systems, linked lists, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Electronics and Circuit Design</strong>: Engaging in hands-on labs where I’ve worked with PIC32 microcontrollers, designed circuits, and developed solutions using sensors, comparators, and other components.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Creating systems for embedded applications, such as memory management systems for memory allocation policies and the implementation of simulators for complex systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’m also continuously learning new programming languages and technologies. Currently, I am advancing my knowledge of Python, Swift, and C++, and I strive to gain proficiency in new tools and techniques that can expand my career prospects.</p>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to the field of <strong>embedded systems</strong> and <strong>microcontroller-based solutions</strong>. I am particularly interested in designing systems that bridge the gap between software and hardware, ensuring that both components interact seamlessly. My ambition is to work in a field where I can use my skills to design intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.</p>

        <p>I aim to pursue opportunities that involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Design and Optimization</strong>: Helping companies design efficient and innovative systems that can improve the performance of everyday devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems Development</strong>: Working on the development of microcontroller-based solutions for industries like healthcare, automation, and consumer electronics.</li>
            <li><strong>Research and Development</strong>: Engaging in the R&D of cutting-edge technology, particularly in areas such as AI, IoT, and robotics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Field?</h2>
        <p>The intersection of <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong> has always fascinated me. Whether it’s through embedded systems, microcontrollers, or the complex algorithms behind various technologies, I love solving problems by combining both worlds. This passion for finding innovative solutions drives my academic and career ambitions.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in engineering projects, you can find me on the <strong>basketball court</strong>, working on my physical health and improving my athletic performance, or <strong>swimming</strong> to maintain a healthy balance between my academic and personal life. Additionally, I enjoy <strong>problem-solving challenges</strong>, whether they are coding problems or logic puzzles.</p>
