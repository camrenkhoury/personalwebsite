        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Camren Khoury. You will see this website grow as my skills grows, as well as I find the time to update the styles and information. I Plan to use this
        website to offer a perspective on my projects, learning, and experiences that a resume alone can not do, as well as include all of the little fun projects and details. Obviously this
        website was hand-written by me in HTML and CSS, however in the future I plan to upgrade to using React and JavaScript features  during my next front-end adventure. Feel free to check out my about section and my portfolio section as
        they will be intervally updated.</p>
